# Chat_GPT_api
This is using tech with Tims code. Really useful for me, If I am ever getting qualitative data from web scraping I can use this to analyse it. 
Using the openai library and an api key you can send questions to chat gbt and recieve answers.
for small freelance traders this access to an API can be brilliant.
Example use case:
with access to a twitter API
follow influential accounts 
get tweets immediatly with API
Use chat to decide if it will effect a stock price 
ask it to respond in one of three ways

stock: positive
stock: negative
no stock effected

make a trading bot with greater latence then any standard news trader 

Please let me know if interested in working on this project
